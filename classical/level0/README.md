# Caesar Cipher

### Level Zero



## Puzzle

Julius Caesar didn't like people reading his messages. He came up with a way to disguise them from prying eyes. Under the Caesar Cipher the message,

```
ATTACKATDAWN
```

becomes,

```
DWWDFNDWGDZQ
```

Can you figure out his method? 



## Solving

The file `caesar.py` has the function, `solve()`. Write your code in this function, and then run `caesar.py` and see if you're right!

Once you've figured out the secret, you can quickly write some code to decrypt `puzzle.txt`.

*Hint: Can you use the code already present to reverse the operation?*
