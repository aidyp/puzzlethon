# Caesar Cipher

### Level Zero



## Puzzle

Julius Caesar didn't like people reading his messages. He came up with a way to disguise them from prying eyes. Under the Caesar Cipher the message,

```
ATTACKATDAWN
```

becomes,

```
DWWDFNDWGDZQ
```

The file, `puzzle.txt` has been encrypted in this way. You have to decrypt it!



## Solving

### `solve()`

The file `caesar.py` has the function, `solve()`. Write your code in this function, and then run `caesar.py` and see if you're right!

```python
def solve():
	puzzletext = read_puzzle()
	
	# Your code goes here! #
	
	return plaintext # save your answer in this variable
```



*Hint: Can you use the code already present to reverse the operation?*
