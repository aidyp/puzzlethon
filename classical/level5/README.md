# Level 5

The Vignere cipher is perhaps the strongest classical cipher. Level 5 is a slightly weakened version of it. You'll find the stronger version in Level 6. 

The Vignere cipher is best thought of as a repeated Caesar cipher. Recall the Caesar cipher

```
message : HELLO
key     : 3
cipher  : KHOOR
```
